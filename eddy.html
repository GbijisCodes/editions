              I have been searching for the right words to express how I feel about you, and I find myself at a loss. How do you describe the love you feel for someone who has
              brought so much joy and light into your life? It's something so deep and pure that words alone can't do it justice. But I'll do my best to convey just how much
              you mean to me.
            </p>
            <p class="text-[#181111] text-base font-normal leading-normal pb-3 pt-1 px-4">
              From the moment we met, I knew I was scared as shit but there was something special about you. Your smile, your laugh, the way you light up a room, even though you'd still like to referr to yourself as a loner - I was captivated by you, I dont know what exactly it was  or is, or maybe its just alot, and im still finding it hard to comprehend to the point where words can actually describe it. And
              as I've gotten to know you better, my love for you has only grown. You are the most kind, generous, and caring person I've ever met. You make me want to be a better
              person every day.
            </p>
            <p class="text-[#181111] text-base font-normal leading-normal pb-3 pt-1 px-4">
              You understand me in a way that no one else
              ever has, and you love me for exactly who I am. With you, I feel seen, heard, and valued in a way that I never thought possible. 
              And I am so grateful to have you in my life.
            </p>
            <p class="text-[#181111] text-base font-normal leading-normal pb-3 pt-1 px-4">
              I promise to always cherish you, support you, and stand by your side. I promise to be honest, and open with you. I promise to listen to your needs,
              communicate my own, and work together to build something that makes us both happy. I promise to love you unconditionally, and to do everything in my power to make sure
              you feel loved every single day.
